# About Bee Home

 Our lives — and planet Earth as a whole — would be very different if solitary bees didn’t exist. They’re vital for flowers, trees, animals and people. In fact, a third of what we eat depends on these busy, buzzing insects and other pollinators.
 
But, because of human impact, bees are in danger of going extinct. We’ve unwittingly destroyed their homes and natural habitats when building our own homes, gardens and cities. And we’ve turned to pesticides, chemicals and monoculture in farming, causing wildflower meadows to rapidly vanish across the planet.

That’s why we at [SPACE10](https://space10.com) want to make it easy for anyone anywhere to design a beautiful home for these vital species. Bee Home is an open invitation for everyone to give bees the home they deserve — and to make sure that planet Earth thrives.
 
 
# A new era for design and fabrication
 
 Bee Home explores how an open-source approach can improve the way we design, fabricate and distribute physical products. At SPACE10 we believe in a future where anyone anywhere feels empowered to design, customise and fabricate their own sustainable products locally.
